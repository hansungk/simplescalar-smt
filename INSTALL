INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS
-----------------------

The following details how to build and install the SimpleScalar simulators:

	a) vi Makefile

	Make sure all compile options are set for your host, we've listed
	the options for the OS/compiler combinations that were tested,
	uncomment one of these if appropriate.  You'll likely not have to
	change anything for the supported hosts, and if you need to change
	anything, it will likely be the CC variable (which specifies
	the ANSI C compiler to use to build the simulators).  NOTE: the
	simulators must be built with an ANSI-C compatible compiler, if you
	have problems with your compiler, try using GNU GCC as it is known
	to build the simulators on all the supported platforms.

	b) make config-pisa			(to build SimpleScalar/PISA)
	   or
	   make config-alpha			(to build SimpleScalar/Alpha)

	Execute one of the above commands to configure the SimpleScalar
	build.  The SimpleScalar/PISA build executes SimpleScalar PISA
	(Portable ISA) binaries (the old "SimpleScalar ISA"), and the
	SimpleScalar/Alpha build executes statically linked Alpha OSF
	binaries.  If building with MS VC++ on Windows NT, first delete
	the symbolic link "tests/".

	c) make

	This builds the simplescalar simulators.

	d) make sim-tests

	This tests the simulators, this step will take anywhere from ~5 min
	to an hour, depending on the performance of your host.  Inspect the
	output of this command, when the script diff's the outputs of the
	simulators against the known good outputs, there should be no
	differences.

	e) vi pipeview.pl textprof.pl

	Configure these two perl scripts by placing the location of your
	perl executable on the first line of each script.


INSTALLATION ISSUES
-------------------
1. (ULTRIX and LINX)
There is a problem with <termio.h> - it calls <sys/termio.h>, but there
isn't a <sys/termio.h>.  I had to put a link in for that one on both my 
ULTRIX and LINUX setups.

2.  (ALPHA running LINUX)
There is a problem in "syscall.c" - there is (apparently) no <bsd/sgtty.h>
on Linux for the Alpha. I commented it out, and it worked.  (This is Redhat
4.2, I think).

3. (WINDOWS NT)
As of SimpleScalar 3.0, the SimpleScalar simulator (for PISA or Alpha)
should build out-of-the-box for MS VC++ and Cygnus/Win32 on Windows NT.

NOTE: due to bugs in MS VC++ __int64 support, MS VC++ version 5.0 plus
service pack 3 (or later) is required to build SimpleScalar/Alpha.

NOTE1: the SimpleScalar PISA compiler tools will not build on Windows NT.
Either build the binaries on another little-endian supported platform,
or grab them from the binaries release available from the same place
you found this package.

There are some deficiencies with this port; specifically, some of the
system calls made by SimpleScalar PISA or Alpha OSF binaries have no
obvious counterparts under WinNT (e.g., getrusage()), when these system
calls are made, a warning is printed.  A better way to use SimpleScalar
on Windows NT is to rely completely on extern I/O traces (EIO traces).
Generate these on a more capable host and then run them on Windows NT.
Since only file I/O is required to run an EIO trace, any tracable program
can later re-run under Windows NT.  See eio.readme in the doc directory
for details...

Steve Reinhardt ported the simulators to the WinNT/Cygnus environment.  Thanks!
