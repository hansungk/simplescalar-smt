# Things to do

* Round-robin dispatch + on-demand switch to available thread
* Load multiple programs

# Things to add

* Program counters per thread
* Register files per thread

# Things to modify

* 1 register file -> an array of register files

# Things to note

Instructions are executed at the switch stmt in ruu_dispatch().
(execution before commit?)

M-Sim implements separate RUUs.
Shared RUUs complicate branch recovery logic.

## Issue logic

ruu_dispatch(): RSLINK_INIT()?

## Create vector (rename table)

* Only used in ruu_writeback()?
