* Frontend misses

- Watch for the variable ruu_fetch_issue_delay.
- Watch ruu_dispatch()
- Seems like RUU = ROB
  - struct RUU_station

** I-cache/I-TLB misses
** Branch misses
- recover_inst is always branch instruction
  - they're all F_CTRL
  - but SOME of them are F_DIRJMP as well
- Detected in ruu_dispatch, handled in ruu_writeback (via ruu_recover)

Q.
- FMT free()?
